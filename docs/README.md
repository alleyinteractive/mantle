=============

Mantle is a framework for building large, robust websites and applications with
WordPress. Mantle extends WordPress Core and acts as a layer between WordPress
and your custom code, aimed at helping you write more structured, testable, DRY,
clean code, and doing so more quickly.

## Goals and Philosophy
Mantle is a heavily Laravel-inspired framework for improving the WordPress
developer experience. It aims to make the development process delightful for the
developer. WordPress can already accomplish great things out of the box. Mantle
aims to make it easier and simpler to use. Code should be fluent, reusable, easy
to read, testable, and delightful to work with.
